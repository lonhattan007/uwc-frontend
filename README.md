# UWC Frontend

## Prerequisites

- Node v16; it is recommended to install Node with [nvm](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/)

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

## Bootstrap

- Clone this project

- Run the following commands inside the project folder:
	```bash
	npm install
	npm run dev
	```

## Workflow

- To work on a new feature, checkout a new branch from the `main` branch on your local machine:
	```bash
	git checkout -b <branch-name>
	```

- To push changes from that new branch to the repo for the first time:
	```bash
	git push -u origin <branch-name>
	```

- After that you can just push changes simply with `git push`.

- When a feature is ready for merging, create a `pull request`.

- __NEVER PUSH TO THE MAIN BRANCH__
